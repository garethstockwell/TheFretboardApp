# TODO

This file captures miscellaneous TODO items which are not recorded in the REQUIREMENTS.md file.

## Definitely

* Migrate to Redux.
* Fix layout when in landscape mode.
   * Login screen is congested - TextInput fields overlap 'remember me' switch.
   * Menu bar is not wide enough.
* Replace ListViewSectioned with a tree view.
   * Category nesting depth may be greater than one level.
* Keep some context on screen when showing spinner (e.g. when navigating between pages).
* Wait for a short time before showing the scene spinner.
* Gesture-based navigation (e.g. swipes) between page.
* Jump to page.

## Maybe

* "Send feedback" (for use during beta testing).
* Pre-load previous and next pages in background.
